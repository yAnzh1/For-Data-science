# Time Series Analysis: ARIMA and GARCH Models

#### This repository contains implementations of ARIMA and GARCH models for time series analysis. These models are widely used in econometrics and finance for modeling and forecasting time series data. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to build, fit, and evaluate these models using Python.

## Introduction

- The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a popular statistical method for time series forecasting. It combines autoregression, differencing, and moving average components to model a variety of time series patterns.

- The GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model is used to model time series data with time-varying volatility, often seen in financial markets. It extends the ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model by incorporating lagged conditional variances.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks in this repository, you need to have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- statsmodels
- arch
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/time-series-analysis.git
```

2. Change to the repository directory:

```bash
cd time-series-analysis
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the `ARIMA.ipynb` notebook to explore ARIMA model implementation.
3. Open the `GARCH.ipynb` notebook to explore GARCH model implementation.

## ARIMA Model

The `ARIMA.ipynb` notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the time series data.
2. **Model Identification**: Identify the order of the ARIMA model using ACF and PACF plots.
3. **Model Fitting**: Fit the ARIMA model to the data.
4. **Model Diagnostics**: Check the residuals of the fitted model to ensure they are white noise.
5. **Forecasting**: Use the fitted model to make forecasts and evaluate the performance.

## GARCH Model

The `GARCH.ipynb` notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the time series data, particularly focusing on returns data for financial time series.
2. **Model Specification**: Specify the GARCH model, including the order of the GARCH and ARCH terms.
3. **Model Fitting**: Fit the GARCH model to the data.
4. **Model Diagnostics**: Analyze the residuals and conditional variance to assess the model fit.
5. **Forecasting**: Use the fitted model to forecast future volatility and evaluate the performance.
